Since then there has been problems and the seller Grabmore has not cared to look into this since the last 4 months. The funny part is the sale happened on 8th April. and the return date is 16th April, by which date the product wudnt have reached. So basically this is no warranty. May be the product works for some, but definitely avoid this seller.</span>   </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>",
